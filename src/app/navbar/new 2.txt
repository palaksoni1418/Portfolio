About Me

I'm a Front-end Developer from Alpharetta, GA. 
I'm passionate about building excellent User Experience/ User Interface that improves the lives of those around me. 
I specialize in creating UI for clients ranging from individuals and small businesses all the way to large corporations.
What would you do if you had a UI expert available at your fingertips?
